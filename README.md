🚀 Excited to share my new SQL Project!  

🛒 SQL Project: E-Commerce Sales Analysis  
I created an e-commerce database with Customers, Products, Orders, and Payments tables.  
Using SQL queries, I analyzed:  
✔️ Top-selling products  
✔️ Monthly revenue trends  
✔️ Top-spending customers  
✔️ Most popular payment methods  

📊 Insights:  
- Laptops generated the highest sales revenue.  
- Credit Card was the most used payment method.  
- Revenue showed steady growth in early 2025.
